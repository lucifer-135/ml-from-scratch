# ml-from-scratch
Machine learning without the crutches. Every algorithm — linear regression, logistic regression, polynomial models, softmax, k-means, and neural networks — is coded manually using basic Python and NumPy. All math implemented by hand. Comes with datasets, train/test splits, and simple scripts that show the raw mechanics behind how ML actually works.
